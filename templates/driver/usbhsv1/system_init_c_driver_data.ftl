/*  When designing a Self-powered USB Device, the application should make sure
    that USB_DEVICE_Attach() function is called only when VBUS is actively powered.
	Therefore, the firmware needs some means to detect when the Host is powering 
	the VBUS. A 5V tolerant I/O pin can be connected to VBUS (through a resistor)
	and can be used to detect when VBUS is high or low. The application can specify
	a VBUS Detect function through the USB Driver Initialize data structure. 
	The USB device stack will periodically call this function. If the VBUS is 
	detected, the USB_DEVICE_EVENT_POWER_DETECTED event is generated. If the VBUS 
	is removed (i.e., the device is physically detached from Host), the USB stack 
	will generate the event USB_DEVICE_EVENT_POWER_REMOVED. The application should 
	call USB_DEVICE_Detach() when VBUS is removed. 
    
    The following are the steps to generate the VBUS_SENSE Function through MHC     
        1) Navigate to MHC->Tools->Pin Configuration and Configure the pin used 
		   as VBUS_SENSE. Set this pin Function as "GPIO" and set as "Input". 
		   Provide a custom name to the pin.
        2) Select the USB Driver Component in MHC Project Graph and enable the  
		   "Enable VBUS Sense" Check-box.     
        3) Specify the custom name of the VBUS SENSE pin in the "VBUS SENSE Pin Name" box.
